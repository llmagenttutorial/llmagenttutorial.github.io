            Web applications serve as vital interfaces for users to access information, perform various tasks, and engage with content. Traditional web designs have predominantly focused on user interfaces and static experiences. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there’s a paradigm shift as we integrate LLM-powered agents into these platforms. These agents bring forth crucial human capabilities like memory and planning to make them behave like humans in completing various tasks, effectively enhancing user engagement and offering tailored interactions in web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
             In this tutorial, we delve into the cutting-edge techniques of LLM-powered agents across various web applications, such as web mining, social networks, recommender systems, and conversational systems. We will also explore the prevailing challenges in seamlessly incorporating these agents and hint at prospective research avenues that can revolutionize the way we interact with web platforms.

        <h3 class="title is-3">Tutorial Outline</h3>

        <ul>
          <h2 class="title is-4">Introduction</h2>
          <p>We introduce datasets that facilitate LLM-based recommendation models. This is particularly important for data-centric machine learning such as LLM-based recommender systems, since the pre-training of LLMs largely determines the ability and utility of LLM-based recommendation.</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="title is-4">Large language models for recommender system</h2>
          <p>We organize and introduce recent LLM-based recommendation models, their relationships, various pre-training, fine-tuning and prompting strategies of LLM-based recommendation models, and possible directions for future improvements.</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="title is-4">Trustworthy Large language models for recommender system</h2>
          <p>We introduce research on the trustworthiness on LLM-based recommender models, including hallucination, fairness, transparency, robustness, and controllability.</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="title is-4">Toolkit [<a href="https://github.com/agiresearch/OpenP5"><b>OpenP5</b></a>]</h2>
          <p>We introduce existing open-source models and platforms to facilitate LLM-based recommendation research, including both LLM backbones such as T5 and LLaMA, and LLM-based recommendation platforms such as OpenP5.</p>
          <br />
          <h2 class="title is-4">Summary</h2>
          <p>Finally, we introduce existing industrial LLM systems that support recommender functionality and their advantages and problems to improve. Examples include ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing and Google Bard.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
